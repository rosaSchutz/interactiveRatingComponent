## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Tailwindcss
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I've been using TailwindCSS a bit, and I'm still working on some things. One of the things I need to improve is how I set the font family. I can't seem to get the bold style to apply to the title. I'm not sure if it's something about the typography I'm using.
